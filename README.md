## Description <a id="description"></a>
This was my final portfolio project for our bootcamp class. I used react to build the site, react made building this front end site extremely user friendly. I styled it with tailwindcss, if you have styled with tailwind I suggest your try it. It's user friendly and has so many options to use. I also used react-icons, react-scripts and react-scroll for styling. The site is hosted on Github pages. A link will be provided below.

## Usage <a id="usage"></a>
Open the page on the nav bar you have About Applications Contact and Resume clicking any of the links will take you to the corresponding section of the page. In applications you can click the link to visit the live sites of my previous projects. In contact there is a contact form leave your name email and a message it goes to my gmail inbox. Email me and Ill send you a friendly hello! If you click Resume it will take you to the footer section of the page where you will find links to my prfiles on Github, linkedin, twitter and link that takes you to googledocs so you can print a copy of my resume. You may not have noticed but all of the weblink for social media used the correct colors for their logos and also have the actual logos of the company. This was achieved by using inspect to find the color code and React's Font Awesome. When your finished save your scroll finger energy and click my custom logo (built in canva) and you will be delivered back to the navigation bar!
